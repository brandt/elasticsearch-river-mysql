Mysql River Plugin for ElasticSearch
====================================

The Mysql River plugin allows to hook into Mysql replication feed using the excellent 
[python-mysql-replication](https://github.com/noplay/python-mysql-replication) and automatically index it into elasticsearch.

This plugin is based on the [elasticsearch-river-couchdb](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-river-couchdb.git) plugin.



Installation
============

This river consists of two parts : 
 - one is the elasticsearch plugin
 - the other one is a little webserver to serve an http stream of the mysql replication stream.


The river
---------

To install this plugin, first build it using `mvn clean package`.
Then, use the plugin binary distributed with elasticsearch `/path/to/elasticsearch/bin/plugin -url file:./target/releases/elasticsearch-river-mysql-*-SNAPSHOT.zip -install mysql-river`

Mysql replication stream
------------------------

You first need to install dependencies : 
 - `easy_install pymysql`
 - `easy_install cherrypy`
 - `git clone git://github.com/noplay/python-mysql-replication.git ; cd python-mysql-replication ; python setup.py install`


Running the river
=================

 - `python http_stream/http_stream.py`
 - `/path/to/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch`


Plugin activation and configuration
===================================

  curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/mydb/_meta' -d '{
      "type" : "mysql",
      "streamer" : {
          "host" : "localhost",
          "port" : 999,
      },
      "mysql" : {
        # Future usage to configure mysql access from the river.  _
      }
  }'



Editing the plugin
==================

To edit the plugin using eclipse, run `mvn eclipse:eclipse`, then you can import the current directory as an existing project in eclipse.


Bulking
======

Bulking is automatically done in order to speed up the indexing process. If within the specified **bulk_timeout** more changes are detected, changes will be bulked up to **bulk_size** before they are indexed.
